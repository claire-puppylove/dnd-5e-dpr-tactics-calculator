# Pivot Table

New Sheet: DPR Summary.

## DPR rating

The Rating Column is automatic, but no text can be output, so I'll add a manual column that has to be updated.

```
=IF(
    ISBLANK(L4)=FALSE,
    IFS(
        L4=0,
            "â˜†â˜†â˜†  No damage",
        AND(L4>0,L4<2),
            "ðŸ¡‡ðŸ¡‡ðŸ¡‡  Not helping (lowest)",
        AND(L4>=2,L4<3),
            "â˜…â˜†â˜†  Low (support, control, debuff)",
        AND(L4>=3,L4<4),
            "â˜…â˜…â˜†  Target (expected)",
        AND(L4>=4,L4<5),
            "â˜…â˜…â˜…  High (heavy hitter)",
        L4=5,
            "ðŸ•±ðŸ•±ðŸ•±ðŸ•±  Over Powered (dude stop)",
        1,"-"
    ),
    ""
)
```

I also decided to do one by one in conditional formatting:

```
=0: "â˜†â˜†â˜†  No damage"
<2: "ðŸ¡‡ðŸ¡‡ðŸ¡‡  Not helping (lowest)"
<3: "â˜…â˜†â˜†  Low (support, control, debuff)"
<4: "â˜…â˜…â˜†  Target (expected)"
<5: "â˜…â˜…â˜…  High (heavy hitter)"
=5: "ðŸ•±ðŸ•±ðŸ•±ðŸ•±  Over Powered (dude stop)"
```

But it goes away if I change the table...never mind.
